## 🚀 About Me
I'm an IT engineer, specializing in infrastructure. My development skills being what they are, I mainly use ChatGPT and Claude AI to move forward quickly. The idea of creating this project is to shed more light on a project I'm very fond of, and to have a clear representation of Galeon's presence in hospitals around the world.

The development and maintenance of this repository is done voluntarily, as community member and Galeon investor.
